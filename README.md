This repo contains Python scripts related to the article "Exact nonlinear state estimation" published in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences:

Chipilski, H. G., 2025: Exact nonlinear state estimation. J. Atmos. Sci., 1-50, https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-24-0171.1.

The main script to run is 'single_DA_trial.py', which reproduces Fig. 5 from the paper. The purpose of the code is to compare the 3 ensemble filters tested in the idealized statistical experiments (EnKF, QCEF-LR and ECTF).
